Gym Buddy

	We used this time to air out any details that were becoming a hindrance to anyone personally for their portions. The group used this time to solve any of these on going issues and then bring up possible concerns within the timeline. As we are approaching final demos we wanted to see what should be the main focus for this week. As a group we decided our main priorities for each portion and continue to focus on that. 
	We got all developers accounts linked to the main firebase account and are slowly working for a cleaner merge. 

Kyle – Working to incorporate the database
Maher – Got the emulator to run and linked the firebase account
Ragib – Working on user preferences
Kevin – converting message system for the new application
Bashar – working on the matching algorithm for the new application
