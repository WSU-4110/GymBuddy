Gym Buddy

	Coming into this meeting Kevin and Ragib had the biggest issues with the emulator not working for them. They are looking at many possible solutions to get that portion going so they can test their parts of the code. 
  This has created slight issues but as a group many solutions were pushed to them and they will be focusing and spending more time to get caught up to speed
	The group continued after this to talk about what else is needed for the project and how it should act. This incorporated with the timeline remaining has led to the discussion if anything needed to be cut out.
  The group decided everything will work out and may have time with extra features possibly.  
	The next topic was about the GitHub and how everything should be organized for the final submission. We created timelines to get these done.

Kyle – On backup polishing the code
Maher – On backup
Ragib – Working on user preferences and fixing emulator
Kevin – converting message system for the new application and fixing emulator
Bashar – working on the matching algorithm for the new application
