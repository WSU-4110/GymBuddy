Scrum Meeting- GymBuddy

We continue to cover what needs to be worked on and what aspects will need to be improved. We wanted to look into firebase for help with our database, storage, and authentication.

We brought up topics and necessary implementations to understand what needs to be done for next weekâ€™s presentation. 

Finished with the retrospective of the good and bad.
