#Installation.MD

To run the application, download the files in the main branch. It is not yet published and deployable on a smart phone but you can run it on an emulator. Since some features are implemented using Firebase, we highly recommend using Android Studio's emulator to run the application.

When opening the project on your personal computer, you might get several errors because you are not registered on Firebase. One way to solve these issues is to import the missing libraries. To do so, hover the mouse on the errors, the IDE should ask you if you want to import the missing libraries, select 'import.'
